# Data Science<br/> Machine Learning<br/> and Python

### <span style="color:#3333FF">New</span>
The Baseball project has moved to a new github repo and has been completely revised.  Scripts to download, parse, tidy, validate, and clean open source baseball data are used to create the initial csv files and optionally load the data into Postgres.  These are at [baseball analytics](https://github.com/sdiehl28/baseball-analytics).  Examples of baseball data analysis using Jupyter notebooks are also published in that repo.

### Overview

This website has five sections:

* **Jupyter Notebooks** learning by example with code and detailed explanations.
* **Recommendations** for learning resources.
* **Course Reviews** of dozens of online courses I have completed.
* **Posts** about Data Science, Machine Learning and Python.
* **About** this website and myself.

The main body of work is the Jupyter Notebooks.

### Primary Libraries Discussed 
- Python Standard Library
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Scikit Learn

### Target Audience

This website is for people who have been introduced to Python, Data Science and Machine Learning, but who are not yet experts.
