### Website Goals

What distinguishes this website from many other resources on Data Science and Machine Learning?

There are many excellent books and online courses which teach Data Science and Machine Learning.  There are also excellent code examples which implement these concepts. In my Recommendations section, I have provided links to some of the best resources I have found. So what can I provide that is different?

As a 20-plus year professional software developer, I can offer a software developer's perspective on how to use, and how to learn how to use, APIs such as the Scikit Learn API.  As someone with an undergraduate degree in physics, I can present a scientific approach to problem solving.

Gaining confidence with an API comes through experimenting with specific use cases of its key methods.  Just as a scientist keeps a notebook of their experimental setup, results and analysis, so too can a data scientist or a someone learning how to use an API.  Juptyer Notebooks are a wonderful tool for this.

Most of the Jupyter notebooks presented here will have a specific data science or machine learning goal.  As the Jupyter notebook progresses towards that goal, an emphasis will be placed on how to experiment with key API methods in order to understand the details of how these methods contribute towards the goal.

### Primary Libraries  
- Scikit Learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Numpy
- Python Standard Library

### Target Audience

Readers who are familiar with the basic concepts of Data Science and Machine Learning, and who have written some code in each of the above mentioned libraries, but are not yet experts, will likely gain the most from this website.
