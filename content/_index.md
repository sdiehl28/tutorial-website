### Website Goals

In creating this website, I had to carefully consider what I could offer that is different from what is already available.  There are excellent books and online courses which teach Data Science and Machine Learning.  There are excellent code examples which implement these concepts.  In my Recommendations section, I have provided links to the best resources I have found for learning the concepts and seeing code in action.  So what can I offer that is different? 

As a professional software developer with over 20 years of experience, and as someone who has an undergraduate degree in physics, I can understand the concepts in depth while offering a professional developer's perspective as how to use key APIs, such as Scikit Learn.

Over the years, I have learned many APIs and I have learned how to learn a new API.  The knowledge I would like to pass on to the reader is how to gain confidence using Scikit Learn and related APIs to solve real world Data Science and Machine Learning problems.

Gaining confidence with an API comes through experimenting with specific use cases of its key methods.  Just as a scientist keeps a notebook of their experimental setup, results and analysis, so too can a data scientist or a someone learning how to use an API.  Juptyer Notebooks are a wonderful tool for this.

Most of the Jupyter notebooks presented here will have a specific data science or machine learning goal.  As the Jupyter notebook progresses towards that goal, an emphasis will be placed on how to experiment with key API methods in order to understand the details of how these methods contribute towards the goal.

### Primary Libraries  
- Scikit Learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Numpy
- Python Standard Library

### Target Audience

Readers who are familiar with the basic concepts of Data Science and Machine Learning, and who have written some code in each of the above mentioned libraries, but are not yet experts, will likely gain the most from this website.
