# Data Science<br/> Machine Learning<br/> and Python

### Overview

This website has five sections:

* **Jupyter Notebooks** with code with explanations
* **Recommendations** for learning resources
* **Course Reviews** of courses I have taken
* **Topics** information about Data Science, Machine Learning and Python
* **About** this website and myself

### Primary Libraries Discussed 
- Python Standard Library
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Scikit Learn

### Target Audience

Readers who have been introduced to Python, Data Science and Machine Learning, and who are wondering what the next steps might be.

As of the time of this writing, February 2019, this website assumes introductory knowledge of Python, the Python Standard Library, and numpy.  For an excellent free youtube talk on numpy, see: [Enthought Numpy youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0D2mhVt7NE). The github resources for this talk are at: [Enthought Numpy Github Repo](https://github.com/enthought/Numpy-Tutorial-SciPyConf-2018).  Included in the resources is "slides.pdf", which starting on page 18, provides an excellent and concise introduction to numpy.
