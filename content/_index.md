# Data Science<br/> Machine Learning<br/> and Python

### <span style="color:#3333FF">New</span>
In depth, [10 Jupyter notebook series](/projects/iterative_model_dev/) on building Machine Learning Models using the latest features from Scikit Learn 0v.21 (released in May 2019).

The Baseball notebooks are undergoing a major overhaul.  Scripts to download, parse, tidy, validate and clean open source baseball data will be used to create the initial csv files.  These are at: [baseball analytics](https://github.com/sdiehl28/baseball-analytics).  Examples of baseball data analysis will be published in new notebooks.

### Overview
