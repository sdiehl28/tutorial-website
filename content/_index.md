## Software Nirvana
This website is a collection of tutorials and topics primarily about Python, Data Science and Machine learning, by Stephen Diehl.

#### Who This is For

This website is aimed at practitioners.  The focus will be on Jupyter Notebook code available from my public github account.  This website will briefly describe what the code does and provide a link to it, but the primary content will be in the Jupyter Notebooks.
