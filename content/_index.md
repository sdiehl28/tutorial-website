### Software Nirvana
**2018-03-03: Under Construction: Website and Jupyter Notebooks not yet written!**

A website about Python, Data Science, Machine Learning and related topics.

#### Preface

What distinguishes this website from other ML tutorials:

* emphasis on iteratively improving model accuracy
* emphasis on avoiding overfitting (or overstating model accuracy on out-of-sample data)

The ML process described here will:

* quickly create a baseline model
* iteratively improve upon that model

**The model building process be demonstrated using a series of Jupyter Notebooks with each notebook representing the next evolution of the model.**

Model Improvement means:

* improved accuracy or interpretability
* improved workflow

Benefits of Good Workflow include:

* reproducibility
* ability to easily experiment with new ideas
* fewer software and model evaluation bugs

A predictive model is something that evolves through a series of iterative cycles each of which measures improvement.

#### Who This is For

Beginning and intermediate practitioners of Data Science and Machine Learning.

It is assumed you have written some Python, Pandas and Scikit Learn code, but may not be comfortable putting all the pieces together.

#### Projects

The best way to learn is to work on actual projects.

The first project will use a popular dataset from Kaggle, the Titanic dataset.

Within the context of refining the predictive model, links to tutorial Jupyter notebooks will be presented.  These tutorials focus on mechanics, such as how to use Pandas.  The project notebooks on the model building process, that is, putting all the steps together and iteratively refining them.

#### Posts and Reviews of Books, Courses and Tools

Data Science and Machine Learning are built on top of many disciplines, each of which has a large number of topics in their own right.  As such, Data Science and Machine Learning encompasses a vast number of topics.  Beginners are often overwhelmed at the number of books and courses recommended, *just to get started*.  But no one can *start* with dozens of resources.

My aim will be to suggest only the most important (in my opinion)  resources in order to allow the reader to get started.
