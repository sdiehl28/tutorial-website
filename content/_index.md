### Software Nirvana
**2018-02-28: Under Construction: Website and Jupyter Notebooks not yet written!**

A website about Python, Data Science, Machine Learning and related topics.

#### Preface

This website was motivated by observing that the majority of "Kaggle Kernels" published to help novice machine learners, make the very serious mistake of "data leakage".  This is true even of kernels published by some of Kaggle's own staff.

Perhaps the thinking is that it's too hard to teach beginners a correct machine learning workflow, so let's present an easier, albeit seriously flawed workflow instead.  I disagree.  Unlearning a bad habit can be more difficult than learning a new good habit.

If you do not know what "data leakage" is, that's fine.  It will be defined shortly.  For now it is important to realize that "data leakage" may lead to improperly tuned models as well as highly inflated estimates of model accuracy on out-of-sample data.  These are series problems in the real world usage of predictive models.

As the Kaggle tutorials that most often exhibit "data leakage" refer to the Kaggle Titantic dataset, that is the dataset that will be used here.

I believe there is a way to teach beginners, in a clear step-by-step manner, with an emphasis on code, that allows them to develop good habits right from the very beginning.

Machine Learning is a difficult topic to teach it relies on many disciplines and creating even a simple model requires performing many different types of steps.  This website and associated Jupyter Notebooks will not attempt to teach Machine Learning, rather this website will simply discuss, in detail, a proper way to create a simple predictive model.  The emphasis will be on code, not theory, with an emphasis on how to avoid 





This website is a collection of tutorials and topics about Python, Data Science, Machine Learning and related topics.





The initial motivation behind this website is to address beginning Machine Learning practitioners.  A popular introductory project for beginners is based of the Kaggle Titantic dataset.  Unfortunately the majority of the Kaggle Kernels, including some published by Kaggle staffers themselves, make a very serious mistake of "data leakage".  Apparently the thinking is that beginners are better off starting with a machine learning workflow that if used in practice leads to aggresious errors, than it is 

It is meant to provide supplementary material addressing areas that may be confusing to beginners.  It is not mean to be used as a sole resource.

#### Who This is For

The target audience is beginning and intermediate practitioners of Data Science and Machine Learning.

It is assumed you have written some Python, Pandas and Scikit Learn code, but may not be comfortable putting all the pieces together.

#### Projects

The best way to learn is to work on an actual project.  The first project will orient around the Kaggle introductory competition for the Titantic dataset.  Within the context of refining the predictive modeling workflow for the Titantic competition, short tutorials will be presented.

#### Tutorials

For each topic, a short introduction will be presented with links to Jupyter Notebooks.  The Jupyter Notebooks will be the primary teaching tool.  Code will be emphasized over theory, but the code will be carefully explained.

#### Posts and Reviews of Books, Courses and Tools

Data Science and Machine Learning are built on top of many disciplines, each of which has a large number of topics in their own right.  As such, Data Science and Machine Learning encompasses a vast number of topics.  Beginners are often overwhelmed at the number of books and courses recommended, *just to get started*.  But no one can *start* with dozens of resources at once.  And yet it is necessary to get started somewhere.

My goal here will be to provide just the most important (in my opinion) resources in order to make "getting out the door" possible.
