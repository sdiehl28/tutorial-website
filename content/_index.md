### Software Nirvana
**2018-02-27: Under Construction: Website and Jupyter Notebooks not yet written!**

This website is a collection of tutorials and topics about Python, Data Science, Machine Learning and Software Engineering.

It is meant to provide supplementary material addressing areas that may be confusing to beginners.  It is not mean to be used as a sole resource.

#### Who This is For

The target audience is beginning and intermediate practitioners of Data Science and Machine Learning.

It is assumed you have written some Python, Pandas and Scikit Learn code, but may not be comfortable putting all the pieces together.

#### Projects

The best way to learn is to work on an actual project.  The first project will orient around the Kaggle introductory competition for the Titantic dataset.  Within the context of refining the predictive modeling workflow for the Titantic competition, short tutorials will be presented.

#### Tutorials

For each topic, a short introduction will be presented with links to Jupyter Notebooks.  The Jupyter Notebooks will be the primary teaching tool.  Code will be emphasized over theory, but the code will be carefully explained.

#### Posts and Reviews of Books, Courses and Tools

Data Science and Machine Learning are built on top of many disciplines, each of which has a large number of topics in their own right.  As such, Data Science and Machine Learning encompasses a vast number of topics.  Beginners are often overwhelmed at the number of books and courses recommended, *just to get started*.  But no one can *start* with dozens of resources at once.  And yet it is necessary to get started somewhere.

My goal here will be to provide just the most important (in my opinion) resources in order to make "getting out the door" possible.
