I have a Bachelor's Degree in Physics from the University of California, San Diego.

When I put on my scientist's hat, my aim is to present a scientific approach to model building.  Physics is the modeling of the world through mathematics.  Machine Learning is the modeling of data through computer algorithms.  These mindsets are very similar.

I am a professional software developer with over 20 years of software development experience.

When I put on my software developer hat, my aim is to present posts and Jupyter notebooks having to do with the *software process* of building Machine Learning models as well as explaining some of the details of the Scikit Learn API.

I love hiking up mountains.  Reaching the summit of a difficult mountain requires optimizing elevation gain with respect to physical energy expended.  This requires optimizing equipment, weight, pace, food and water, start time, physical training and more.  Some of my mountain day hikes over the last 18 months include:

* Mount Whitney (14,505)
* White Mountain CA (14,252)
* San Gorgonio (11,503)
* San Jacinto from Idyllwild (10,833)
* San Gorgonio (11,503)
