Each project uses a single dataset and develops concepts with successive Jupyter Notebooks.  The theme of the first project is "Iterative Model Development".

### Software Versions

To see what versions of the software library this website uses:
<a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sdiehl28/tutorial-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/snippets/ShowVersions.ipynb" target="_blank">Show Versions</a>

You should use similar or newer versions to ensure you get the same results.

### Binder

[Binder](https://mybinder.org/) is an awesome tool for executing Jupyter Notebooks found in a github directory.  All the links on this website use nbviewer to display my Jupyter Notebooks, however an excellent alternative is to use the following link for my github repo: [My Jupyter Notebook Repo via Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sdiehl28/tutorial-jupyter-notebooks/master).  It may take a moment while a docker image spins up in the background and allows for Jupyter Notebook execution.
