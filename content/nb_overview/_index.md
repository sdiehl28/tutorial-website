Jupyter Notebooks are perhaps the easiest way to learn and experiment with code.

Nbviewer is a free service which renders a link to a public Jupyter notebook as a read-only web page in your browser.  In addition, nbviewer offers the option to download the Jupyter Notebook it is displaying or execute it on Binder.

All the links on this website use nbviewer to display my Jupyter Notebooks.  Simply click on the link.  For example: [Show Versions](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sdiehl28/tutorial-website/blob/master/static/jupyter_nb/ShowVersions.ipynb)

To use Binder from the nbviewer page, simply click on the 3 ring icon in the top right of the nbviewer page.  This will take you to the binder site where you will be allowed to execute the Jupyter Notebook.  For details about how this works see: [MyBinder How It Works](https://mybinder.org/#how-it-works)

### Package Versions

The package versions I am using on my workstation, as of Jan 11th, 2019, can be seen with: [Show Versions](
http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sdiehl28/tutorial-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/snippets/ShowVersions.ipynb)

I am using the Anaconda distribution which I highly recommend.  See [Getting Started](/getting_started)

If you install a recent version of Anaconda, your packages will be the same or later and my notebooks should work the same in your environment.
