### Jupyter Notebooks and IDEs

The easiest way to learn and experiment with code is to use a Jupyter Notebook.

With a Jupyter Notebook, you can enter your own notes about your own experiments.  You can execute each block of code and get immediate text or graphical feedback.  This note taking and immediate visual feedback reinforces the concepts to your mind, making them easier to remember and use in practice.  Furthermore, you can revisit your notebook at any time for a quick reminder.

The best way to be efficient in a professional programming environment, is to use an IDE. The best IDE in my opinion is [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).  Other popular IDEs include [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) with their appropriate plug-ins.  

Reiterating, I believe most people will learn faster and better remember what they learn using Jupyter Notebooks, and most people will be more productive at work using an IDE.

A free service which makes it easy to share Jupyter notebooks with others is [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).  Nbviewer also offers the option to download the Jupyter Notebook it is displaying or execute it on Binder.

All the links on this website use nbviewer to display my Jupyter Notebooks.  Simply click on the link.  For example: [Show Versions](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sdiehl28/tutorial-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/snippets/ShowVersions.ipynb)

To use Binder from the nbviewer page, simply click on the 3 ring icon in the top right of the nbviewer page.  This will take you to the binder site where you will be allowed to execute the Jupyter Notebook and make temporary changes to it.  For details about how Binder works see: [MyBinder How It Works](https://mybinder.org/#how-it-works)

### Python Package Versions

The package versions I am using on my workstation, as of January, 2019, can be seen with: [Show Versions](
http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sdiehl28/tutorial-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/snippets/ShowVersions.ipynb)

I am using the Anaconda distribution which I highly recommend.  See [Getting Started](/getting_started)

If you install a recent version of Anaconda, your packages will be the same or later and my notebooks should work the same in your environment.
