Data scientists need to interact with data.  Data in Python is stored in the form of a Pandas DataFrame.  Data in R is stored in the form of a R DataFrame.  Data in a relational database is stored in the form of tables.

Pandas, dplyr and SQL are all similar to each other in that each implements similar data operations.  For example: filter (rows and/or columns), join, group, aggregate, etc.
