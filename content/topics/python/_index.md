### Python Popularity

As of December 2019, and likely to remain so for quite some time, Python is the fastest growing programming language.

To quote from [Tiobe](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) in June 2019:

> ### June Headline: Python continues to soar in the TIOBE index
>
> This month Python has reached again an all time high in TIOBE index of 8.5%. If Python can keep this pace, it will probably replace C and Java in 3 to 4 years time, thus becoming the most popular programming language of the world.

A few notes about the above chart.  C is mostly used for embedded and systems programming. Visual Basic .NET is mostly used for interacting with Windows applications.  Java is more popular than Python, but Python is the language rising fastest in popularity.  Interestingly, the use of R has decreased over the last year.  It appears Python has won the Python vs R battle for use in business.

The rise in popularity of Python is no doubt driven by the rise in popularity of Data Science and Machine Learning.  Python offers excellent support for Data Science with Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn and more.  Python offers excellent support for Machine Learning with Scikit Learn, Keras, and more.

A development team that is using Python for Data Science and Machine Learning will likely be inclined to use it for other tasks as well, thereby further increasing its usage.  Python is also a great general purpose language much used for web development, scripting and more.

Python was designed to be easy to read and understand.  As code is more often read than written, this reduces development time.  Reduced development time translates into reduced costs for businesses that create software products or perform data analysis.

Python, combined with its standard library, is a very powerful tool.  A few lines of code can do a lot.  Python is much more concise than languages like Java and C++.

### Python

Unless stated otherwise, I will use the term "Python" to refer to both the core language and the standard library that ships with it.

Some Python terms:

* module: a .py file intended to be reused containing one or more functions or classes
* package: a collection of modules.  In other programming languages, this is often called a library
* Python Standard Library: the collection of packages that ship with every Python distribution

Python is open source, free, and in addition to the standard library, there are tens of thousands of free packages available on [Pypi](https://pypi.org/).

Loosely speaking, Python can be divided as follows:

1. those aspects which are familiar to any software developer
2. those aspects which are specific to Python, sometimes called "Advanced Python"

A developer coming from another language can immediately make use of Python.  Similarly, a new developer, or someone more focused on Data Science or Machine Learning than programming in general, can also quickly make use of Python.

That said, the real beauty and power of Python come from those aspects which are specific to Python.  Here are some recommendations for learning [Advanced Python](/books/adv_python).

In the Jupyter Notebooks under this Python section, the purpose is not to teach Python per se, but rather to provide examples of key points which may be unclear to newcomers.

There are many excellent resources for learning beginning Python.  Among these, I would recommend these [Udemy Courses](/reviews/special/udemy) as well as the tutorials at  [Real Python](https://realpython.com/).
