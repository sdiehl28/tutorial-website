### Python Popularity

As of January 2019, and likely throughout all of 2019, Python is the fastest growing programming language.

Modern Data Science is likely the main reason for Python's recent rise in popularity.  Packages such as Pandas (data science) and Scikit Learn (machine learning) have become very popular.  Python is also a great general purpose language for web development, scripting and more.

Python was designed to be easy to read and understand.  As code is more often read than written, this reduces development time.  Reduced development time translates into reduced costs for businesses that create software products or perform data analysis.

Python, combined with its standard library, is a very powerful tool.  A few lines of code can do a lot.  Python is much more concise than languages such as Java and C++.

### Python

Unless stated otherwise, I will use the term "Python" to refer to both the core language and the standard library that ships with it.

Some Python terms:

* module: a .py file intended to be reused containing one or more functions or classes
* package: a collection of modules.  In other programming languages, this is often called a library
* Python Standard Library: the collection of packages that ship with every Python distribution

Python is open source, free, and in addition to the standard library, there are tens of thousands of free packages available on [Pypi](https://pypi.org/).

Loosely speaking, Python can be divided as follows:

1. those aspects which are familiar to any software developer
2. those aspects which are specific to Python, sometimes called "Advanced Python"

A developer coming from another language can immediately make use of Python.  Similarly, a new developer, or someone more focused on Data Science or Machine Learning than programming in general, can also quickly make use of Python.

That said, the real beauty and power of Python come from those aspects which are specific to Python.  Here are some recommendations for learning [Advanced Python](/books/adv_python).

In the Jupyter Notebooks under this Python section, the purpose is not to teach Python per se, but rather to provide examples of key points which may be unclear to newcomers.

There are many excellent resources for learning beginning Python.  Among these, I would recommend these [Udemy Courses](/reviews/special/udemy) as well as the tutorials at  [Real Python](https://realpython.com/).
