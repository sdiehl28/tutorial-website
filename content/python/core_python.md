#### Notebooks
1. [Core Python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sdiehl28/tutorial-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/python/CorePython.ipynb)
2. [Core Python 2](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sdiehl28/tutorial-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/python/CorePython2.ipynb)

These notebooks do not teach Python per se, rather they present code examples to clarify some issues that are commonly misunderstood.

The Core Python 2 notebook is more advanced than Core Python.
