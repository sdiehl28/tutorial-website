### Development Environment

Perhaps the easiest way to get started is to install the Anaconda distribution of Python.  By default this includes Pandas and Scikit Learn.

There are many excellent tutorials on how to install Anaconda, such as [Python Tutorial Anaconda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJC6ldI3hWk).
