### Python vs R

I believe it easier to learn Data Science and Machine Learning concepts in R.  Hadley Wickham's packages modernize R and make it easily accessible to those who already know SQL, for example.

On the other hand, I feel it is more practical to implement solutions in a business environment in Python.  A software development team will likely have experience with Python and such [DevOps ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) practices as unit testing, continuous integration, Docker, etc.  Whereas a R user is not often found on a software development team and rarely has exposure to [DevOps ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) (or [DataOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataOps)) which is essential for deploying real-world solutions.

This website will use Python for most discussions and examples.

### What is a "Beginner"?

A person with 10 or more years of experience is likely to say that something that only requires 3 years of effort to learn, is a "beginning" topic.  A person with 5 years of experience is likely to say that something that only requires 1 year of effort to learn is a "beginning" topic.  A person with 1 year of experience is likely to say that something that only requires 3 months of effort to learn is a "beginning" topic.  In other words, the term "beginner" is a relative term.

This can cause a "beginner" to become quite frustrated.  One topic classified as "beginner" seems easy whereas another seems impossibly difficult.   This does not mean that you are not able to understand the topic, rather it means that the term "beginner" is being used for something more advanced than your current level.

In my experience, any topic which seems unusually hard to learn is a topic for which I do not have a solid understanding of the prerequisites.  If I understand the prerequisites, no topic is difficult.  My recommendation is that if you get stuck on something, instead of beating your head against a wall and feeling bad about yourself, take a step backwards and review the material that leads up to that topic.

On this website, I will use the term "beginner" to mean something that requires up to about 1 year of professional experience to learn and use well.

### Development Environment

All code here uses the Anaconda distribution of Python.   There are many excellent Anaconda installation tutorials on the web, such as:

### JupyterLab

As of the time of this writing, [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is in beta, but it is ready for use.  JupyterLab is a great way to develop Jupyter notebooks.  I would also recommend the JupyterLab extensions for spell checking and table-of-contents.
