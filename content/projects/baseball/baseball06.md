#### Notebook: [Wrangle & Persist to CSV](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sdiehl28/tutorial-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/python/BB06-RetroWranglePersistCSV.ipynb)

#### Goals
* The cwgame parser created data that is not in "tidy format".
  * Put game information (e.g. attendance) in one DataFrame
  * Put team-game information (e.g. Home Team scored 10 runs, Visiting Team scored 5 runs) in another DataFrame
* Persist the wrangled data to CSV files.

#### Next

Persist data to Postgres using bulk load.
