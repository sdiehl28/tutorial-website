#### Notebook: [Helper Functions](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sdiehl28/tutorial-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/python/BB02-HelperFunctions.ipynb)

#### Goals
* Provide a set of helpful functions used by all Baseball Notebooks

The most important functions are those that read/write the DataFrame to CSV files along with the DataFrame's column types.

A CSV file by itself contains no column type information.  By writing out an additional CSV file that does contain the DataFrame column type information, the DataFrame can be reconstructed from the CSV data file and the CSV column type file.

#### Next

Describe the organization of the data.
