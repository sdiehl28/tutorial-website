### Iteration 4: Custom Age Imputation with Pipelines

Jupyter Notebook: [Impute Age](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sdiehl28/tutorial-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/projects/Titanic01.ipynb)

This Jupyter Notebook is more instructional than functional.

One type of overfitting is Test Set Leakage.  This occurs when you look at your test data prior to building your model.

A model is trained on a train dataset and evaluated on a test dataset.  In cross validation, to be discussed later, this is performed multiple times.

For a wonderful anecdotal story by one of the luminaries of Statistical Machine Learning, Robert Tibshirani, in which a Ph.D. oral dissertation presenter chose which columns to include using both the train and test data, and the effect this had on his medical research, watch: [Cross Validation: Right and Wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S06JpVoNaA0&list=PL5-da3qGB5IA6E6ZNXu7dp89_uv8yocmf)
