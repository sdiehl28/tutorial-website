It is useful to consider model building as part of an iterative software development process.

A simple model, informed by Exploratory Data Analysis, can be created.  Once a model is up and running, it can be refined through subsequent software iterations.

#### Technical Prerequisites

This series of 10 notebooks is most helpful if you understand:

- [Python Objects](<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc>) - first 4 videos or similar
- [Pandas Groupby](<https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_pandas/python_pandas_groupby.htm>) or [My Pandas Groupby](<https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sdiehl28/tutorial-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/python/Pandas03.ipynb>) or similar
- [Seaborn v0.9.0 or higher](<https://seaborn.pydata.org/>) and in particular [relplot](<https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/relational.html#relational-tutorial>) and [catplot](<https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/categorical.html#categorical-tutorial>) which simplify the creation of facetgrid plots.
