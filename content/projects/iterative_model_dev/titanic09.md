#### Notebook: <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sdiehl28/tutorial-jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/projects/titanic/TitanicN09.ipynb" target="_blank">Ensembles</a>
#### Goals  
- Custom Code a Stacking Estimator
- Tune its Base Learners and Meta Learner and Evaluate
- Use VotingClassifier and Evaluate
- Custom Code a Forest of Decision Trees and Evaluate

#### Results  
Similar results were obtained with Stacking, Voting, and Forest.  The mean scores were slightly above the best found for a single model, but the confidence interval overlapped to such an extent that it cannot be said that any of the ensemble methods did better.

The Titanic data set is too small and simple to benefit from more advanced techniques. 

#### Next

Building an Interpretable Model.
