In order to best use the machine learning algorithms provided in R or Python, a basic understanding of how these algorithms work is required.

Recommendations

- [Introduction to Statistical Learning  Book](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) and [Introduction to Statistical Learning Videos](http://www.dataschool.io/15-hours-of-expert-machine-learning-videos/)
- [Applied Predictive Modeling](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Predictive-Modeling-Max-Kuhn/dp/1461468485)

The above books are presented using R.  However if you search online, you can find Python solutions to the exercises.
