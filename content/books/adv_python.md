Advanced Python is not necessary if your goal is just to learn Data Science and Machine Learning.  However if your goal is to write production quality applications in Python, then knowing more than the basics is essential.

Recommendations:

* [Fluent Python](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1491946008)
* [Python Cookbook 3rd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Cookbook-Third-David-Beazley/dp/1449340377/)

For software developers coming to Python from another programming language, or for those who have completed a beginning Python book or course, *Fluent Python* is excellent.

For numerous examples of advanced real-world Python recipes, *Python Cookbook 3rd Edition* is excellent.
