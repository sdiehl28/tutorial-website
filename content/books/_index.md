I believe it is more helpful to someone getting started to present a short list of excellent books than it is to present dozens of books.

I find it is also helpful to reread the best books, being sure to fully grasp the material, before moving on to other books.

For many people,  [online courses](/reviews) are better than books, or are better to start with than books.

The following sections present my short list of the best books for key subject areas.
