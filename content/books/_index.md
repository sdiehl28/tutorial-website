### Recommendations

I am a strong believer in taking the time to find a few of the best books, and then reading and rereading these books. It is better to read an excellent book twice, and fully grasp what the author is presenting, than it is to read two mediocre books.

For some people, it may be helpful to read two excellent books on the same subject at the same time. This provides two different perspectives making it less likely that you will get stuck on any particular topic.

For some people, [online courses](/reviews) may be better than books.

The following sections present my short list of the best books for the key subject areas.
