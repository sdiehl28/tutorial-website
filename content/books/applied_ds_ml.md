The software libraries used for Data Science and Machine Learning in Python are changing very rapidly.  Many books published over 2 years ago are already out-of-date.

Data Science and Machine Learning is such a hot field that many authors are publishing books just to make money quickly.  In my estimation, only about 5% of all books now being sold are both relevant and present the material properly. 

As of February 2020, I no longer have a favorite book per se, but rather a favorite online set of Jupyter Notebooks which are constantly being updated to stay relevant.  These are by [DunderData](https://www.dunderdata.com/).

* [Master Data Analysis with Python](https://www.dunderdata.com/master-data-analysis-with-python)
* [Master Machine Learning with Python](https://www.dunderdata.com/master-machine-learning-with-python)

Each of the above have many dozens of Jupyter Notebooks, as well as a PDF generated from the Jupyter Notebooks.  The author is constantly striving to address the questions most asked by students, and this feedback from student to presenter to updated Jupyter Notebook, is what makes these Jupyter Notebooks stand out.
