The software libraries used for Data Science and Machine Learning in Python are changing very rapidly.  Many books over 2 years old are already out-of-date.  It is worthwhile to check the publication date.

Recommendations

- [Master Data Analysis with Python](<https://www.dunderdata.com/master-data-analysis-with-python>) -- Best resource for learning Pandas.  The material is continuously being update, with the latest update occurring in November, 2019.  This is distributed as a pdf and a set of Jupyter Notebooks.
- [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow-ebook/dp/B07XGF2G87/) -- Published September 2019.

Both of the above are excellent.
