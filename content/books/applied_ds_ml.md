The software libraries used for Data Science and Machine Learning in Python are changing very rapidly.  Many books over 2 years old are already out-of-date.  It is worthwhile to check the publication date.

Recommendations

- [Master Data Analysis with Python](<https://online.dunderdata.com/courses/master-data-analysis-with-python-volume-1-foundations-of-data-exploration>) -- Continuously updated.  As of this writing, last update was June 24th, 2019.
- [Machine Learning with Python Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Python-Cookbook-Preprocessing/dp/1491989386/) -- Published April 2018.

Both of the above books are excellent.
