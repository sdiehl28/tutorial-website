An essential prerequisite to Machine Learning is the equivalent of one course in statistics. Without basic statistics, it is difficult to understand how to properly use, evaluate, tune, and compare Machine Learning models.

Recommendation

* [Practical Statistics for Data Scientists](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Statistics-Data-Scientists-Essential/dp/1491952962)

The traditional approach to teaching statistics is not well suited for data science. The approach taken by the above book is excellent. This book uses R, but as R was designed for statistical computing, it is a more natural language for learning statistics than Python.

The above videos are short and straightforward and yet manage to convey the key concepts exceptionally well.
