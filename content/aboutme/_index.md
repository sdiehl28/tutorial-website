I am a professional software developer with over 20 years of experience.

I received a Bachelor's Degree in Physics from the University of California, San Diego.

Physics is the modeling of the world using the language of mathematics.

Machine Learning is the modeling of data using machine learning models.  What motivated me to learn physics, is very similar to what motivates me to learn Machine Learning.

I am an avid hiker, having day-hiked Mount Whitney for the second time in September of 2017.
