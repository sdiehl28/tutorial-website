For most people who already have a professional career, the best way to learn Data Science and Machine Learning is to take online courses.  If you take the time to chose the best courses for who you are and what your goals are, the value for you time and money is excellent.

There are many excellent online courses available.  In the following sections I review courses that I have completed.

#### Python vs R Note for Online Learning

Some courses are taught only in R.  If your goal is to work with Python, you may not enjoy the time you have to spend to learn R.  However this will introduce you to Hadley Wickham's excellent plotting package called ggplot2 and excellent set of packages called tidyr.  Arguably, these packages are better than their equivalents in Python with one significant drawback; the elegant syntax only works in the global namespace.  This means that you cannot easily use ggplot2 and tidyr within R functions.  However when you are learning Statistics, Data Science and Machine Learning, you are most often using an interactive session in the global namespace.  I would argue that R is excellent for learning Data Science and Machine Learning.

For implementing software solutions, after you have learned the basics, Python with Pandas and Scikit Learn are arguably better than R.
