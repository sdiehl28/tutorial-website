For most people who already have a professional career, the best way to learn Data Science and Machine Learning is to take online courses.  The career value for your time and money is excellent.

For some academically oriented people who are early in their careers, pursuing an academic degree at an accredited university may be the best path.

There are many excellent online courses available.  The following is a review of some courses I have completed.

### Coursera vs Data Camp vs College University

I am only reviewing courses I have taken.  There are many excellent online courses you can take other than the ones reviewed here.

A college degree or graduate certificate may carry the most weight on a resume or LinkedIn profile.  If you can afford it and have the time, you can't go wrong with this approach.  For most people though, Coursera or Data Camp will be a better alternative.

Coursera courses are taught by professors at well known universities.  Coursera is more academically oriented than most online courses.  If you enjoyed college, you will likey enjoy Coursera courses.  If you have the time, I recommend both Coursera and Data Camp as they compliment each other nicely.  However if your goal is to get coding ASAP, then Data Camp may be the place to start.

Data Camp has the best platform for learning how to code for Data Science and Machine Learning.

Udemy is also an excellent choice.  Any course by Jose Portilla is excellent.  Boris Paskhaver has an in-depth course in Pandas that is also excellent.
