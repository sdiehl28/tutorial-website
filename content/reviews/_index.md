For most people who already have a professional career, the best way to learn Data Science and Machine Learning is to take online courses.  If you take the time to chose the best courses for who you are and what your goals are, the value for you time and money is excellent.

For some academically oriented people who are early in their careers, pursuing an academic degree at an accredited university may be the best path.

There are many excellent online courses available.  In the following sections I review courses that I have completed.

#### Python vs R Note for Online Learning

Some courses are taught only in R.  If your goal is to work with Python, you may not enjoy the time you have to spend to learn R.  However this will introduce you to Hadley Wickham's excellent plotting package called ggplot2 and excellent set of packages called tidyr.  Arguably, these packages are better than their equivalents in Python with one significant drawback; the elegant syntax only works in the global namespace.  This means that you cannot easily use ggplot2 and tidyr within R functions.  However when you are learning Statistics, Data Science and Machine Learning, you are most often using an interactive session in the global namespace.  I would argue that R is excellent for learning Data Science and Machine Learning.

For implementing software solutions, after you have learned the basics, Python with Pandas and Scikit Learn are arguably better than R.

### Coursera vs Data Camp vs College University

A college degree or graduate certificate may carry the most weight on a resume or LinkedIn profile.  If you can afford it and have the time, you can't go wrong with this approach.  For most people though, Coursera or Data Camp will be a better alternative.

Coursera courses are taught by professors at well known universities.  Coursera is more academically oriented than most online courses.  If you enjoyed college, you will likey enjoy Coursera courses.  If you have the time, I recommend both Coursera and Data Camp as they compliment each other nicely.  However if your goal is to get coding ASAP, then Data Camp may be the place to start.

Data Camp has the best platform for learning how to code for Data Science and Machine Learning.

Udemy is also an excellent choice.  Any course by Jose Portilla is excellent.  Boris Paskhaver has an in-depth course in Pandas that is also excellent.
