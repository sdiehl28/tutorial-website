Sal Kahn is an excellent teacher and his Kahn Academy is free.  Some classes are now taught by people other than Sal.  If you want free training on the fundamentals, I recommend:

* [Calculus 1 & 2](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-home)
* [Multivariate Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus)
* [Statistics and Probablity](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)
* [Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)

Understanding Calculus and Linear Algebra, are nice to haves, but are not essential to getting started.

Understanding elementary Statistics and Probability is essential. As mentioned previously, I recommend the first 3 courses of the: [Statistics with R Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics) and/or [Practical Statistics for Data Scientists](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Statistics-Data-Scientists-Essential/dp/1491952962).
