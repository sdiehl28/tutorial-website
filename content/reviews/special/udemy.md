Udemy courses are on sale seemingly 50% of the time.  A $200 course might go for just $10 during the sale.

Udemy is now starting to offer interactive quizzes, but their quiz platform is no where near as good as Data Camp's interactive web platform.

The best Udemy courses are excellent.

In particular, I recommend:

* [Complete Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/) for a thorough introduction to Python
* [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview) for a less thorough, but broader introduction to Python, Data Science and Machine Learning
* [Data Analysis with Pandas and Python](https://www.udemy.com/data-analysis-with-pandas/learn/v4/overview) for a step-by-step introduction to Pandas
