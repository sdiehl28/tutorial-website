Udemy courses are often on sale and when they are on sale, they are well worth their cost.  Udemy is just now starting to offer interactive quizzes, but their quizzes are no where near as good as DataCamp's interactive web platform.  Nevertheless, the quality of the best Udemy courses is excellent.  In particular, I recommend:

* [Data Analysis with Pandas and Python](https://www.udemy.com/data-analysis-with-pandas/learn/v4/overview) for a step-by-step introduction to Pandas
* [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview) by Jose Portilla (or any course by Jose Portilla)
