Udemy and other low cost or free online courses such as Kahn Academy can be excellent.  These resources don't provide as good a learning platform as Data Camp or Coursera and as such could lead a beginner into thinking that they understand the material better than they actually do.  However if you have enough self-discipline to carefully go through the exercises on your own, these can be very helpful.
