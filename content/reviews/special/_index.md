Udemy and other low cost or free online courses such as Kahn Academy can be excellent.

These resources don't provide as good a learning platform as Data Camp or Coursera which may result in thinking that you know more than you actually do.  However if you have enough self-discipline to carefully go through the exercises on your own, these courses can be very helpful.  They are particularly helpful when used in conjunction with other resources such as books or other online courses.
