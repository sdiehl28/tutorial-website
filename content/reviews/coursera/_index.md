Coursera courses are taught by college professors from excellent universities such as Standford, John Hopkins, Duke, etc.  These courses are more practical than typical college courses, but still emphasize fundamentals more than many other DS and ML online courses.

Most courses are either 4 or 5 weeks with the last week consisting of final project which is peer reviewed.  Of the 14 final projects I had peer reviewed, I only disagreed with one question on one exam.  Each reviewer is provided with a clear "how to grade" document, and the grading is very fair.  Multiple choice quizzes are given each week and the quiz grading is by computer.  You can retake a quiz.  This is very helpful as a small percentage of the quiz questions are ambiguous and need to be taken more than once to get the right answer even if you know the material.

Of the 14 courses I have taken, I only disliked how one was taught.   This is a higher percentage of good professors than I had in college and my college is consistently ranked in the top 40 nationally.

If you have the time, Coursera courses compliment courses such as those from DataCamp nicely.  In the following sections I review courses from the 3 Coursera specializations I have taken.
