### Statistics with R Specialization

The [**Statistics with R Specialization**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics) is a 5 course specialization with the 5th course being a capstone project.  I completed the first 3 of these courses.

This series of courses is taught by professors from Duke University.  Mine Cetinkaya-Rundal teaches the first 3 courses.

Mine is aware of exactly which topics beginning statistics students struggle with and she takes the time to place extra emphasis on these.  Mine is a superb statistics professors.

The courses use R, but I would argue that R is the easiest language to learn statistics in.  Even if you plan on developing in Python, I would recommend learning statistics in R.

This series of courses is sufficient to allow you to understand most of the statistics referenced in beginning Data Science and Machine Learning.
