### Statistics with R Specialization
The [**Statistics with R Specialization**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics) is a 5 course specialization with the 5th course being a capstone project.  I completed and will review the first 3 courses.  The courses are taught by professors from Duke University. Mine Cetinkaya-Rundal teaches the first 3 courses.

The 5 week courses I completed were:

- Intro to Probability and Data
- Inferential Statistics
- Linear Regression and Modeling

Mine is aware of exactly which topics statistics students struggle with and she places an emphasis on these.  If you have ever struggled with statistics, Mine is the professor to have.

The courses are taught in R, but arguably R is the easiest language to learn statistics in. 

This series of courses is sufficient to allow you to understand most of the statistics referred to in beginning Data Science and Machine Learning texts and courses.
