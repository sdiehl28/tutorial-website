#### Data Science Specialization

The  [**Data Science Specialization**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) is a 10 course specialization with the 10th course being a capstone project.  I completed and will review the first 8 courses.  The courses are taught by professors from John Hopkins University.  All courses are taught using R.

The 4 week courses and their professor follow.

* Data Scientist's Toolbox (Roger Peng)
* R Programming (Roger Peng)
* Cleaning Data (Jeffrey Leek)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (Roger Peng)
* Reproducible Research (Roger Peng)
* Inferential Statistics (Brian Caffo)
* Regression Models (Brian Caffo)
* Practical Machine Learning (Jeffrey Leek)

I felt the choice of topics covered was excellent.  Roger Peng is a fantastic professor.  The only course I felt was not taught well was Inferential Statistics.  However this is easily remedied by taking the excellent [Statistics with R Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics) by Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel.  If you are rusty on your statistics, I would recommend taking at least the first 3 courses in this specialization, all of which are taught by Mine, prior to taking the 6th course (Inferential Statistics) in the Data Science Specialization.
