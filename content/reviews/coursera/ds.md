#### Data Science Specialization

The  [**Data Science Specialization**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) is a 10 course specialization with the 10th course being a capstone project.  I completed the first 8 courses.  The courses are taught by professors from John Hopkins University.

The 4 week courses I completed were:

* Data Scientist's Toolbox (Roger Peng): intro to git, github, markdown, installing R, etc.
* R Programming (Roger Peng): introduction to R and R programming
* Cleaning Data (Jeffrey Leek): reading data, dplyr, regex, etc.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (Roger Peng): base plotting, ggplot2, clustering, PCA, etc.
* Reproducible Research (Roger Peng): R Markdown, etc.
* Inferential Statistics (Brian Caffo): std error of the mean, distributions, hypothesis testing, p-values, etc.
* Regression Models (Brian Caffo): least squares, residuals, inference, multivariate, logistic, etc.
* Practical Machine Learning (Jeffrey Leek): cross validation, caret, random forest, regularization, etc.

All courses are taught using R.

I felt the choice of topics covered was excellent.  Roger Peng is a fantastic professor.  The only course I felt was not taught well was Inferential Statistics.  However this is easily remedied by taking the excellent [Statistics with R Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics) by Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel.  If you are rusty on your statistics, I would recommend taking at least the first 3 courses in the Statistics with R Specialization, all of which are taught by Mine, prior to taking the 6th course (Inferential Statistics) in the Data Science Specialization.
