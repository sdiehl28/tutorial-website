#### Data Science Specialization

The  [**Data Science Specialization**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) is a 10 course specialization with the 10th course being a capstone project.  I completed the first 8 of these courses.

This is an excellent series of courses taught by professors from John Hopkins University.  I felt the choice of topics was excellent.  My favorite professor was Roger Peng.

All of the courses are taught using R.

The only course I felt was not well taught was the course on Inferential Statistics by Brian Caffo.  However this is easily remedied by taking the excellent *Statistics with R Specialization* by Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel.
