#### Mastering Software Development with R Specialization

The  [**Mastering Software Development in R Specialization**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/r) is a 5 course specialization with the 5th course being a capstone project.  I completed the first 3 of these courses.

This excellent series of courses is taught by Roger Peng of John Hopkins University.  As a professional software developer myself, I can say that Roger Peng understands software development.  Roger Peng is an excellent professor.

If you intend to develop software in R, I would highly recommend this specialization.
