#### Mastering Software Development with R Specialization

The  [**Mastering Software Development in R Specialization**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/r) is a 5 course specialization with the 5th course being a capstone project.  I completed and will review the first 3 of these courses.  The courses are taught by Roger Peng of John Hopkins University.

The 4 week courses I completed were:

* R Programming Envirnoment
* Adv R Programming
* Building R Packages

Roger Peng is an excellent professor and this is an excellent series of courses.  As a professional software developer, I can say that Roger Peng understands software development very well.

If you intend to develop software in R, I would highly recommend this specialization.
