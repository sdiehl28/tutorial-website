#### Stanford University

##### Data Mining and Applications Graduate Certificate

I took the first (several month long) course some years back.  For me, the cost was prohibitive to continue and the online teaching presentation (a videotape of the professor teaching in the classroom at Stanford), was not as good as Coursera and DataCamp which specifically aim at online learners.  I suspect that the teaching presentation and materials have improved since I took the course.  My professor, Jonathan Taylor, was excellent.

Stanford has fantastic name recognition in Data Science and Machine Learning.  If you have the time and the money, getting a Graduate Certificate from Stanford is an excellent option.
