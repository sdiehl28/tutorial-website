### University of California, San Diego

I received a bachelor's degree in physics from UCSD and very much enjoyed the time I spent there.

Any degree in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) provides an excellent background for learning and using Data Science and Machine Learning appropriately.

For those who already have a degree, you are a step ahead in learning Data Science and Machine Learning.

For those who are considering attending college and have not yet started a career, a university may be an excellent option.

One thing that new students sometimes don't fully appreciate is how important choosing your professor is.  A course whose topic seems interesting but is taught by a poor professor, will not further your education.  On the other hand, almost any course taught by an excellent professor will further your education.
