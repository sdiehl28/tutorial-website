The [Data Science with Python Track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python) consists of 26 courses taught by several different people.  The teaching style of a short video followed by a real coding quiz on their excellent platform, works very well.

I completed all courses which includes topics such as:

* Intro to Python for Data Science
* Cleaning Data
* Pandas
* Data Visualization
* Interactive Visualization with Bokeh
* Statistical Thinking
* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Deep Learning
* Network Analysis

If you already know a topic such as Python, but want credit for the full track, it is easy to rapidly move through the online quizzes for material you already know.  Likewise, it is easy to proceed at any pace that is comfortable for you on new material.

Dhavide Aruliah, Director of Training at Anaconda, taught several courses.  Perhaps due to time constraints, he dropped a lot of technical terms that were not understandable upon first review, but later proved to be quite helpful upon subsequent review.  Everyone who taught, without exception, did a good job.

I believe the Data Science in Python Track is the fastest way to get started with Data Science in Python.  Some of the core concepts were touched upon a little too lightly to fully grasp, but all the core concepts are introduced.  For a more advanced understanding of Machine Learning Concepts, see [ML Concepts](/books/ds_ml_concepts/).  For better mastery with Pandas and Scikit Learn, see [DS & ML Books](/books/applied_ds_ml/).
