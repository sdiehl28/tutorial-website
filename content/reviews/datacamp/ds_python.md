The [Data Science with Python Track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python) consists of 20 courses taught by several different people.  The teaching style of a short video followed by a real coding quiz on their excellent platform, works very well.  Data Camp has by far the best teaching platform of any of the online courses I have taken.

I completed all 20 courses which includes topics such as:

* Intro to Python for Data Science
* Cleaning Data
* Pandas
* Data Visualization
* Interactive Visualization with Bokeh
* Statistical Thinking
* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Deep Learning
* Network Analysis

The Data Camp quiz platform allows you to take the coding quizzes rapidly and move on, if you already know the topic.  Alternatively, you can move at any pace that is comfortable.

Dhavide Aruliah, Director of Training at Anaconda, taught several courses.  Perhaps due to time constraints, he dropped a lot of technical terms that were not understandable upon first review, but later proved to be quite helpful upon subsequent review.  Everyone who taught, without exception, did a godd job.

I believe the Data Science in Python Track is the fastest way to get started with Data Science in Python.  Some of the core concepts were touched upon a little too lightly to full grasp, but all the core concepts are introduced.  If you want to get started as quickly as possible, this track may be the best online course option.  If you are the type who wants to fully understand each topic before moving on, you may need to supplement the teaching videos with additional Data Science resources such as: [DS & ML Books](/books/applied_ds_ml/)
