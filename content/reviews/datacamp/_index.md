Data Camp has by far the best platform for learning how to write code for Data Science and Machine Learning for both Python and R.

Arguably DataCamp does not teach the core concepts quite as well as the Coursera specializations, however if you want to be employed as a Data Scientist, you must know how to code.  DataCamp's interactive web based platform, which provides hints, accepts real code input, and often does the tedious setup code for you, is a quick and effective way to gain "muscle memory" for coding real-world solutions.

If you compliment the DataCamp courses with resources such as those mentioned in [Books](/books/) or other online courses, you will have all you need to get started writing data science and machine learning application code.

Both the R track and the Python track are excellent.  As you might expect, the R track has more emphasis on statistics and the Python track has more emphasis on software development.

I enjoyed taking both tracks.  I found it helped to see the same Data Science and Machine Learning topics presented in two different ways.  That said, I would recommend that you chose either Python or R and stick to one and only one, for at least 6 months.  The differences between the two are significant and until you are well grounded in one, moving on to the other may be confusing.
