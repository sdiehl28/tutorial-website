### Python vs R

Python and R are both excellent. One is not better than the other for Data Science and Machine Learning.

You may prefer R if you have a statistics background or are academically oriented. 

You may prefer Python if you have a developer background or you want to become a developer.

If you can't decide, Python may be best. 

This website will use Python for most discussions and examples.

### Development Environment

All code here uses the Anaconda distribution of Python.   There are many excellent Anaconda installation tutorials on the web, such as:

### Software Versions

If your software versions are about the same or newer, they your code will likely run the same as the Jupyter Notebook code.
