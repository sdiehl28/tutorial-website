### Python vs R

Python and R are both excellent. One is not better than the other for Data Science and Machine Learning.

You my prefer R if you have a statistics background or are academically oriented. 

You may prefer Python if you have a developer background or you want to become a developer.

If you can't decide, Python may be best. 

This website will use Python for most discussions and examples.

### Book Recommendations

I am a strong believer in reading, and rereading, the best 2 or 3 books on a given topic before moving on to other books.  The best books are both practical and present a mindset for how to think about Machine Learning.

The two best books I have found are:

* [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) -- Authors have made available a free PDF.
* [Applied Predictive Modeling](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Predictive-Modeling-Max-Kuhn/dp/1461468485)

The above two books are both presented using R.  However if you search online, you can find people who have published answers to the exercises from both these books in Python.  This can be helpful in understanding the concepts as implemented in Python.

Video instruction is also very helpful.  Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani created a video series to go along with the Introduction to Statistical Learning:

* [Introduction to Statistical Learning Videos](http://www.dataschool.io/15-hours-of-expert-machine-learning-videos/)

My two favorite resources at the moment for Applied Data Science and Machine Learning in Python are:

* [Python Machine Learning Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920085423.do) -- To be released in April 2018. Available nows as an Early Release.
* [Python Data Science handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Science-Handbook-Essential-ebook/dp/B01N2JT3ST) -- Published Nov 2016.

The software used for Machine Learning in Python is changing so rapidly that it is worthwhile to check the publication date of any book on the topic to see if it is roughly 2016 or newer.

A subscription to SafariBooksOnline can be very helpful as it provides you with access to the latest books, published and pre-released: [SafariBooksOnline](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/)

### Online Course Recommendations

Even better than books are online courses. There are many excellent courses available.
