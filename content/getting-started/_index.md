### Introduction

Python and R are both excellent. One is not better than the other for Data Science and Machine Learning.

You my prefer R if you have a statistics background or are academically oriented.  You may prefer Python if you have a developer background or you want to become a developer.  If you can't decide, Python may be best. 

This website will use Python for discussions and examples.
