### Python vs R

Python and R are both excellent.  One is not better than the other for Data Science and Machine Learning.

You may prefer R if you have a statistics background, are academically oriented, or want to try the latest algorithm published in a recent academic paper.

You my prefer Python if you have a developer background, or intend to implement Data Science and Machine Learning applications in code.

If you can't decide, Python may be the best to start with. 

This website will use Python for most discussions and examples.

### Development Environment

All code here uses the Anaconda distribution of Python.   There are many excellent Anaconda installation tutorials on the web, such as:
