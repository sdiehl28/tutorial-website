### Anaconda
Perhaps the easiest way to get started is to install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) distribution of Python.  By default this includes Pandas and Scikit Learn.  This distribution works well with Linux, MacOS and Windows.

There are many excellent tutorials on how to install Anaconda, such as [Python Tutorial Anaconda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJC6ldI3hWk).

### Editors and IDEs
There are many good choices.  If you already have a favorite, then stick with it.

Some Python editors and IDEs to consider include:

- [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/install)
- [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
- [Spyder](https://spyder-ide.github.io/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) with Python plugins
