### Goals

What distinguishes this website from many other resources on Python, Data Science and Machine Learning?

As a professional software developer of over 20 years, I can share the techniques I have learned for quickly getting up-to-speed with a new API, such as Pandas and Scikit Learn.

As someone with an undergraduate degree in physics, I can present a scientific approach to problem solving.

There are so many books, blogs and online courses about Python, Data Science and Machine Learning, that it is hard to know where to get started.  On this website, I will provide you with a concise list of the best resources I have found, as well as reviews of the courses I have taken.

Gaining confidence with an API comes through experimentation with its key methods.  Reading books and taking courses suggests which methods may be the most useful, but it is necessary to directly experiment with these methods yourself to make them part of your skill set.  The Jupyter Notebooks linked to from this website are examples of experimenting with key methods.
